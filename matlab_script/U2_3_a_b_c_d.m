% Consider G1(s) = 1/s+p. Compare in terms of rise time and steady-state
% value the step responses of this system for different values of p.(For 
% purposes of this experiment, assume the following definition of rise time
% : the time taken for the output to reach 90% of the final steady-state value 
% Choose p=0.5,1,2,10. Based on this, where should one locate a pole  if the
% requirement is a fast response? Where should one locate the pole if the
% steady-state value of the output is expected to be equal to the input
% value? Can one independently satisfy both requirements?

%b. Consider G2(s)=10/s2 + as + 10. Compare in terms of rise time, the
%settling time, peak overshoot, and steady-state value. The step responses
%of this system for different values of a: Choose a=0.1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10.
%Ask questions similar to that in 3.a, and discuss the results.

%c. Consider G3(s) = 10/s2 + 2s + 10 in cascade with a first order system
%G4(s)=p/s+p. Repeat the experiment 3.b for different value of p. Choose
%p=5,10,20. In your discussions, include as well a comparison of these
%results with those obtained in 3.b

%d. Consider G4(s)=10(s/a + 1)/s2 + 2s + 10. Repeat the experiment 3.b for
%different values of a. Choose a=0.1,1,10,100. In your discussion, include
%as well a comparison of these results with those obtained in 3.b.
